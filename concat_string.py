# Instructions
# Create a file concat_string.py that contains a function concat which takes in two strings as parameters and performs the following operations:

# Concatenates the two strings by adding a comma and space between them.

# Returns the resulting string.

# Usage
# Here is an example of how to use the concat function in a test.py script:

# import concat_string
# string1 = "Hello"
# string2 = "World"
# print(concat_string.concat(string1, string2))
# Below is the expected output:

# $ python3 test.py
# Hello, World
# $

def concat(str1, str2):
    return str1 + ", " + str2
